# ADR-003 — Email only, no SMS

**Status:** accepted · supersedes the "SMS primary via SSL Wireless" requirement.

SMS gateways in Bangladesh need a paid contract and sender registration. Brevo transactional email is free at this volume and already integrated in the Go API (`internal/services/email_service.go`). Notifications for approval, rejection, credentials, and password reset go by email; in-app `Notification` rows cover the rest.

SMS remains a Phase 2 option. Until then no code should reference an SMS provider, and `FEATURE_SMS_NOTIFICATIONS` style flags should not exist.
