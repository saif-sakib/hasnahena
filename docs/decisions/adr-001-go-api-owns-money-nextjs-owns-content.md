# ADR-001 — Go API owns money; Next.js owns content

**Status:** accepted · supersedes the "Go gateway + Java Spring Boot ledger" design.

A separate Java ledger service was specified and never built, and it is not justified for this scale. Instead: the Go API is the single writer for anything that moves a balance, and Next.js route handlers keep the CMS-style surfaces (registration intake, gallery, settings, worker CRUD, audit viewer) plus pure status transitions.

The split is real duplication and the cost is accepted for now. The rule that keeps it safe: **if it changes a balance, it belongs in Go.** New financial endpoints must not be added to Next.
